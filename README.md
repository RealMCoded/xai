the bot i made for the progressbar95 discord

# Building and Running

This bot uses Node.js, so make sure you have that first ([you can get that from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

Download all modules by running `npm i`, run the bot by running `run.bat` (or `run-no-g.bat` to only initilize the bot for 1 guid and not globaly.)
